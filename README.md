# Hello :)
## I've created a filtering table React app 
### I've followed the "Thinking In React", but with a twist:
In React's tutorial they use class components -> I challenged myself to create the same app using:
* Functional components
* Hooks

# For running the app on a localhost, run the command:
## npm run start
